- A Jenkins server
- Gradle and JDK installed
- Git bash
- JFrog CLI

## Authenticating towards Artifactory

You will need to authenticate to Artifactory either by a username/password
 combination or an API Key. If you use a username/password combination, please
 don't use your "plain password" but instead use the "Encrypted Password" for
 your Artifactory user.

You will find both the `API Key` and your `Encrypted Password` Under
 "Welcome, \<user\>" and "Edit Profile" in the Artifactory UI.
 Unlock with your password and look under "Authentication Settings".

NB: It's not currently possible to do the Gradle exercises using an `API Key`.
