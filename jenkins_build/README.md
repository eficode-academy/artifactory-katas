# Artifactory builds in Jenkins

We want to enable the automatic promotion of artifacts through the maturity repositories. As Jenkins is our defacto build server, we will use the provided Artifactory plugin to interact with the artifact manager.

Our goal in this exercise is to simulate a normal workflow in your production environment, but leave out all the nitty gritty details that makes learning hard.

The end result should be a fully functioning pipeline that takes advantage of Artifactory to:

* Upload
* Download
* Promote throughout the pipeline

Each of the bullets is represented by an exercise below.
In order to do the exercises, you need to setup a job in Jenkins.

> Hint: The goal of this exercise is not to learn Jenkins pipeline syntax, nor groovy, but understanding the options you get in Jenkins. If you get stuck, please refer to the [reference pipeline](./complete_pipeline.md) for help.

## Initial setup of Artifactory

* Go to your bash command line
* `cd jenkins-build`
* `./setup.sh`

This will create the following repositories (and maturity levels):

level 1: `${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-sandbox-local`  
level 2: `${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-dev-local`  
level 3: `${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-regtest-local`  
level 4: `${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-release-local`  

## Initial setup of Jenkins

* Go in and make a new pipeline job in Jenkins. `New Item` --> Name: `$KATA_USERNAME-pipeline` --> Type: `Pipeline` --> `OK`
* Go into the job and paste the following skeleton into the `pipeline` section

```groovy
def artifactory_url="<your-artifactory-server>:8081/artifactory"
def username="<your_user_name"
def encrypted_password="<your-encrypted-password>" // generate it from your Artifactory profile

node {
  def server = Artifactory.newServer url: artifactory_url, username: username, password: encrypted_password
  def buildInfo = Artifactory.newBuildInfo()
  buildInfo.env.capture = true
  stage('Preparation') { // for display purposes
      // This is where you normally checkout your source repository
      deleteDir() //Deletes the entire workspace content
  }
  stage('Build') {
      // "build" some software
      writeFile file: "artifact-1.${currentBuild.number}.txt", text: "this is our artifact from 1.${currentBuild.number}"
      sh "ls -la" //List the artifacts in the log to see if the file is present
  }

  stage('Upload') {
      // PART 1 - Add upload spec here and upload "build.txt" to Artifactory
      def uploadSpec = """{
          "files": [
          {
            "pattern": "putYourPatternHere",
            "target": "putYourTargetHere"
          }
          ]
      }"""
    server.upload spec: uploadSpec, buildInfo: buildInfo
    server.publishBuildInfo buildInfo
  }
  stage('Download') {
      deleteDir() //Deletes the entire workspace, so we rely 100% on Artifactory
      // PART 2 - Add download spec here and download "artifact.txt" and "artifact.tgz" from Artifactory
      def downloadSpec = """{
        "files": [
          {
            "pattern": "putYourPatternHere"
          }
        ]
      }"""
    server.download spec: downloadSpec, buildInfo: buildInfo
  }
  stage ('Automatic Promote'){
      // PART 3 - Promote the build to the next level
  }
  stage ('Interactive Promote'){
      // PART 4 - Interactively promote the build to the next level
  }
}
```
* Change the server name `<your-artifactory-server>` accordingly
* Retrieve your "encrypted" password from your profile in Artifactory
* update the `username` and `encrypted_password` accordingly

This is our baseline.

> Note: we set the credentials and url of the Artifactory server directly in the jenkins file here which are not considered best practice. Consult the [web docs](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Working+With+Pipeline+Jobs+in+Jenkins) for better ways of creating the artifactory connection.

## Part 1: Upload the artifact

In order for you to upload/download artifacts through the plugin, you need to specify a `File Spec`.
File Specs are JSON objects that are used to specify the details of the files you want to upload or download. 

They consist of a `pattern` and a `target`, and a number of optional properties can be added to them.

> Note: The filespec has a lot of options you can work with. For more in depth information, consult the [web docs](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Using+File+Specs).

This is the basic structure of an upload spec:

```misc
{
  "files": [
    {
      "pattern": "[Mandatory]",
      "target": "[Mandatory]",
      "props": "[Optional]", // Properties that will be set to all artifacts uploaded to artifactory
      "recursive": "[Optional, Default: 'true']",
      "flat" : "[Optional, Default: 'true']",
      "regexp": "[Optional, Default: 'false']",
      "explode": "[Optional, Default: false]",
      "excludePatterns": ["[Optional]"]
    }
  ]
}
```

In a Jenkins pipeline, you can define an upload `File Spec` as a multi-line string:

```groovy
def uploadSpec = """{
  "files": [
    {
      "pattern": "putYourPatternHere",
      "target": "putYourTargetHere"
    }
  ]
}"""
```

In order for us to upload files, we need to define two things; `pattern` and `target`. There can be more files in the defined array.

* `pattern` Specifies the local file system path to artifacts which should be uploaded to Artifactory. You can specify multiple artifacts by using wildcards or a regular expression as designated by the regexp property. If you use a regexp, you need to escape any reserved characters (such as ".", "?", etc.) used in the expression using a backslash "\\".
* `target` Specifies the target path in Artifactory in the following format: [repository_name]/[org]/[module]/[revision]/[module]-[revision].[ext]
* `buildInfo` object is being _filled_ with information several times during the pipeline execution (env.capture, upload and download), but it must be `published` to Artifactory explicitly.

It can _only_ be called once during a Jenkins build which means it should be called after the last `upload`/`download` call.

Once you have your upload spec, you can trigger the upload within the pipeline with the following line:

```groovy
server.upload spec: uploadSpec, buildInfo: buildInfo
server.publishBuildInfo buildInfo
```

### Tasks

* in the `upload` step of your jenkins file, make an upload spec that takes the `artifact.txt` and uploads it to the `${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-sandbox-local` repo under `acme/artifact/1.${currentBuild.number}/artifact-1.${currentBuild.number}.txt`
* click save and run the pipeline by clicking `Build Now`
* click on the Artifactory Icon next to the build to go to go to the build.
* navigate to `Published Modules` and click on the module to see the list of artifacts (currently only one).

> **Note 1:** Be aware of the the `${currentBuild.number}` is a Jenkins variable for accessing the build number.

## Part 2: Download the artifact

When we need to download artifacts, we can use File Specs again:

```text
{
  "files": [
    {
      "pattern" or "aql": "[Mandatory]",
      "target": "[Optional, Default: ./]",
      "props": "[Optional]",
      "recursive": "[Optional, Default: true]",
      "flat": "[Optional, Default: false]",
      "build": "[Optional]",
      "explode": "[Optional, Default: false]",
      "excludePatterns": ["[Optional]"]
    }
  ]
}
```

There are two key differences to notice:

* You can use `aql` to search for artifacts like the one below:

> **Note:** If you are running our course, then AQL has not been introduced before. Just keep in mind that this is possible.

```json
   "aql": {
        "items.find": {
            "@build.name": { "\$eq":"${JOB_NAME}" },
            "@build.number": { "\$eq":"${currentBuild.number}" }
        }
```

* You can use `pattern` which target files using their layout like below:

```
      "pattern": "<repo>/<module>/<revision>/*.*"
```

* The `props` attribute is no longer used for setting properties, but as a filter for only downloading the ones where the given property is set.

Now all you need is downloading it through: `server.download spec: downloadSpec, buildInfo: buildInfo`

### Tasks

* Configure your pipeline so it downloads the file you just uploaded.
* Check within the pipeline that a folder is made. You could for instance use `sh "ls -la"` and look at the console output of the Jenkins job.
* run the job and check the logs to see that the folders are made
* Use the `flat` property to download the file to the root of the workspace, ignoring the repository folder structure.
* run the job again and check the logs to see that the artifact is now in the root of the folder

> Hint: you can either make a search on the specific layout, or use the `@` notation to search for build number and name (details can be found [here](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Artifactory+Query+Language#ArtifactoryQueryLanguage-ConstructingSearchCriteria))

## Part 3: Promotion

As your build progresses through the pipeline, your artifacts get promoted to a higher maturity level, and therefore different repository.

Promotion has a different JSON structure than uploading and downloading. Here you can see an example of a promotion structure, defined as a map in a Jenkins pipeline:

```groovy
  def promotionConfig = [
    // Mandatory parameters
    'buildName'          : buildInfo.name,
    'buildNumber'        : buildInfo.number,
    'targetRepo'         : '', //name of the repo to promote the artifacts to

    // Optional parameters
    'comment'            : '', //Comment that will be seen on the build entity
    'sourceRepo'         : '', //name of the repo to promote the artifacts from
    'status'             : '', //Denotion of maturity level for the build.
    'includeDependencies': true, // If your artifact has any dependencies, should they be promoted as well?
    'copy'               : true, // Should the artifacts be moved or copied when promoting from one repo to another.
    // Set it to false, if you don't want the promotion to abort upon receiving the first error.
    'failFast'           : true // 'failFast' is true by default.
  ]
  // Promote build
  server.promote promotionConfig
```

### Tasks

* In the `Automatic Promote` stage of your pipeline, make a promotion config that moves the artifacts from `Maturity level 1 (${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-sandbox-local)` to `Maturity level 2 ${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-dev-local)` repository with the `status` set to `promoted to dev`
* Execute the pipeline
* Click on the Artifactory icon and check that the artifacts gets moved over
* Under the `Diff` tab in the build browser, choose a prior successful build in the `Select A Build To Compare Against:` section and observe the changes.
* Under the `Release History` tab in the build browser, notice that you have an entry called `promoted to dev`

### Part 4: Interactive promotion

As we saw in part 3, we can promote artifacts automatically during the build execution. It is also possible to make a decision later and do the promotion interactively - even when the build has completed.

### Tasks

* In that stage `Interactive promote` make a promotionConfig that promotes the artifacts from `Maturity level 2 (${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-dev-local)` to `Maturity level 3 (${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-regtest-local)` repository.
* Instead of making an automated promotion using `server.promote promotionConfig`, we now want use `Artifactory.addInteractivePromotion server: server, promotionConfig: promotionConfig` to make an interactive promotion.
* Observe in Artifactory that `Maturity level 2 (${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-dev-local)` has the artifact, and `Maturity level 3 (${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-regtest-local)` does not yet have them.
* Go back into the jenkins Ui and click "promote" to promote the artifact.
* Observe in Artifactory that `Maturity level 3 (${KATA_USERNAME}-gradle-regtest-local)` has the artifact now.
* Under the `Release History` tab in the build browser, notice that you have an entry called `promoted to regtest` along the `promoted to dev` status

## FAQ

* Q: I have multiple stages that I want to upload artifacts from, but I can only do one upload per build.
  * A: You have two options: make several builds and loose traceability between them, or wait with uploading till all artifacts have been produced limiting the measurement of maturity progression.
* Q: Should I move or copy my artifacts when i promote?
  * A: Artifactory prefer move and then make virtual repositories spanning several local ones, than to copy. Remember that if you copy, then the properties are not propagated to the other instances of the same artifact.
* Q: while promoting the build, I want to append new properties to the artifacts.
  * A: Unfortunately you cannot do that via the plugin. The rest API on the other hand have that capability, so please look at our [curl promotion](../promote_curl/README.md)
